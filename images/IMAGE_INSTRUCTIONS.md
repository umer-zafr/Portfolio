## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended Size**: 600x800 to 1000x1200 pixels
- **Orientation**: Portrait (vertical)
- **File Size**: Under 500KB for fast loading
- **Style**: Professional coding/workspace photo

## Tips for Best Results:
- Use a photo with good lighting
- Show yourself working on a laptop/computer
- Keep the background clean and professional
- Portrait orientation works best with the design
